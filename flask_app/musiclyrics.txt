i'm not afraid no gyal heart man
anytime people want to start problems
you know who man's are
it's a little chilly out there
and it's all because you chose a side
out here in l.a. i don't know what's going on
i'm fooding and serving them all like i'm working for minimum wage
you can't even figure out what's going on with you
forgiveness for your ways
you're so predictable i hate people like you
you're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
always saw you for what you could've been
but you always had something to say every other time
all of my " let's just be friends " are friends i don't have anymore
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
if i ever loved ya, i'll always love ya that's how i was raised
like when chrysler made that one car that looked just like the bentley
ever since you met me
same way i'm realizing on a day to day
i knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end
my luck is a sure thing 'cause i'm living right
i don't know what's going on
guess that's what they say you need family for
how you supposed to figure out what i'm going through
'cause i can't depend on you anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i should've tried to keep my family closer
and of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
and even when it's business with you it's personal again
you judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
i made a decision last night that i would die for it
i only drove it five times, paid one point five for it
keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
and i can't sleep these days unless i take one
if they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
they give me loyalty and i don't gotta pay for it
i'mma start telling niggas " get it how you can "
first place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
now they wanna act like i do no good
yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
life is always on, man, i never get a break from it
momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
doesn't matter where i go, i can never get away from it
if i ever lose a bet, we never speak again
just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
and i turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
funny 'cause i really did more than i should
all these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
but you don't have the time to wait on me
and that just didn't sit right with you
despite the things you said to me
and getting high with you
world's, world's, world's famous
feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
your body language says it all
you got something that belongs to me
i was only gone for the last few months
there's more to life than sleeping in
and now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
who is it that's got you all gassed up ?
and you don't feel no way, you think i deserve it
now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
i should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
you try to give 'em your side of the story
me i'm just done, done, done, done, done
six cold like alaska
man don't live of a di hype huh ?
you cannot be here right next to me
they always dyin' to mention me
yeah, i pull up in lexus' like it's ' seven
boss up, i'm the bigger homie
i feel like juelz santana
chasin' women a distraction
they love to talk
they just discuss it in private
you know the game is sold separately
the chain too heavy to tuck it, i'm serious
i had to count it and count it again
shout out to tiffany, stephanie
to make sure the money was right
you shouldn't speak on me, period
leg hangin' out the phantom
bustin' one 's out the plastic
but i'm one year older than my lil homie
don't get along man, we tried it
i hate a rapper especially
what's the point of even tryin' ?
i don't know what else is left for me
they heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
her gram too poppin' to fuck her
but i'm young money, got it written on me
swear i just had an epiphany
that boy light as michael jackson
me, i'm just done in the hype
last year i know you learned your lesson
i do my own propaganda
i'ma have b's when i'm seventy
but off verses, he been blackin'
they gotta die out eventually
niggas done being silent
after this no one a threat to me
look what i've done in my life
they gonna die out eventually
they cannot fuck with the legacy
they feeling a way and won't hide it
so don't play with my money this summer, i'm serious
i don't let it get to me
my enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
she violated, i sent her back where it all started
told my momma that i found a lady in the east
and then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
i mean you boys not even coming close
forty the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
and did it with a purpose
leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
you number one and i'm eddie murphy we tradin' places
i'm assumin' everybody's thirty-five and under
you don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
i get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
the most successful rapper thirty-five and under
but i'm happiest when i can buy what i want
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and they still take to it
lookin' in the mirror i'm closer than i really appear
but money can't buy happiness, jellee talkin' truthful
i got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
big apple had the white hummer parked right in front of fluid
and we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
but shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
shout out to kd we relate we get the same attention
you treat me like i'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
creepin' like chilli without the tender, love, and care
feel like i never say much but man there's a lot to know
now the talk of the corner store is that i'm tbe
i used to hit the corner store to get to tahiti treat
your best day is my worst day, i get green like earth day
redemption's on your mind when you think about me
redemption's on your mind when you
sell my secrets and get top dollar
that made me think of you so differently
i know you're seein' someone that loves you
tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
guess i'm not in a position to deal with commitment
sell my secrets back to me if i was payin'
sell my secrets for a range rover
i used to know you back when you was young
i don't want you here with no one else
and then it's too much
i gave your nickname to someone else
it's like they can't get enough
i hate the number two that shit is unforgiven
now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
i'll kill somebody if they give you problems
i get it
i don't wanna do this with no one else
wonder what they'd do put in my position
'cause i'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
damn, i'm not unrealistic with none of my women
west palm girls are spoiled rotten
aw yeah, yeah, yeah
but you say you're over and done with me

they would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
run your mouth, i'd rather listen to someone else
i tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
i wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen ?

and you know what's on my mind
if you had my love
you're to blame for what we could have been
slightly been awake for twenty-four hours, so please forgive me
last night we didn't say it
you say the word, i'm on the way
'cause you know what's on my mind tonight
that your love would be untrue
and i gave you all my trust
and you know what's on my mind, this time
your heart is hard to carry after dark
'cause look at what we are
would you lie to me ?

only child that's takin' care of his mother
ego strokin', picture postin'
and tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
america's most wanted, man, i'm still on the run
in recent years as i get established
sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didn't lose you
i wrote the book on world-class finesses
ones i can't access when i'm stoned sober
and not think about how they receive it
i'm overcome with emotions
please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
and icy heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning ?
better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
with the risk of financially sinkin'
that's not respectable all of a sudden ?
i don't get a pat on the back for the come up ?
how you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches ?
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
grateful like jerry, bob and mickey
trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
the city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
i know i deserve more, i just never said it
way less support from my peers
be honest with myself and take ownership
this the remix to " ignition, " hot and fresh out the kitchen
did i ? did i ?
all these number ones and we still not the ones
i know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
unforgivin' times, but fuck it, i manage
to wantin' to see me lose it all ?
see, i know, 'cause i study you closely
i really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
how they go from not wantin' me at all
why is my struggle different than others' ?
we got it, now we just gotta keep it
claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
i could only speak what i know of
and puttin' your trust in someone
back when i would write
things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
back then it used to just feel like our secret
went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb
i know when someone lyin'
bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down ?
on a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
never met my self, i don't remember who i was face

i don't stop, man, i'm stuck on go, always hug the road
swear to god, shout to buffalo, never duckin' low
i gave them back a clean plate
tryna cool it all down

two-faced nigga back around with the three face
february tan, it's the boy, but i'm still the man
same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release date
we with everything, i went off in the ' sixteen give me ' seventeen

'member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
'cause soon as i'm able to let that go

hope i deal with karma 'fore my son do
i just take the dreams i've been sold
every time we touch down, bet it go up
till me and bein' broke finally broke up
no more nine to five autopilot dri-i-i've
time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
i just gotta try harder
and sell 'em for more, you already know
thorn in my eye, as you beg i testified that
then it all just switched, over time
you see that i've been goin' through it
with the waves under the wavecap
things are gettin' hot and heavy
scared to see what i left behind
i know and i miss you
you slipped out, if you don't know already
i can't help but wonder how you've been, babe
girl, i can't pretend

step by step and you know what's next
we gotta listen to the old kelly
you slipped out if you don't know already
what is not already mine ?
you proved her right, every single night
girl, i know you know how it's gon' go down
my mama said you was bad news, like " dun-dun-dun-dun "

malibu coast where i meditate

it's weighin' heavy on my mind
oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes

i hate being alone, girl, you finally got me out my zone
know how to treat you, but it's difficult
girl, i know you know already
saturday to saturday
what are you on ?
you said that you think about me every day
i don't trust a word you say
they look up to me
straight up to my face, straight up to my face
somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
i can tell that love is fake
yeah, straight up to my face, tryna play it safe
vibe switch like night and day, i can see it like right away
yeah, i know they wanna take my place
i got fake people showin' fake love to me
like one, three, yeah
whole time they wanna take my place
that's when they smile in my face
no you can't son me, you won't never get to run me
how you wanna clique up after your mistakes ?
look you in the face and it's just not the same
look like you hidin' your problems
i came up, you changed up, i caught that whole play
just when shit look out of reach, i reach back like one, three
i've been down so long it look like up to me
nigga, what you thought ?
whoa, whoa, whoa
icy like there's nobody you'd ever need
baby, i'm needin' somethin', somethin'
i wanna see you do more in this life if we takin' it there
you need to give love to someone
better not give that up
better not give that up to anyone but me
you need to stop watching me
slatt, slatt, slatt
thought i had everything somehow
icy like one thousand and seventeen
feelin' rough, rough
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, jeffery
i still need some satisfaction
i know you did, he did a number on you
see you when i see the real thing
i need you out in jamaica, relaxin'
a little less talk and a little more action
you need to give it up to someone
before you end up like
gettin' realer and realer, yeah, yeah, yeah
i wan' beat it up with somethin' somethin'
you're a diamond out the rough or somethin' somethin'
always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
steady doin' double shifts
get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
all the love i need is here at ovo, yeah
last table left in carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
more blessings because i'm generous
if we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
there's real ones around me
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
seven am in germany, can't believe that they heard of me
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
i can never sleep till morning on all my quiet nights
he can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
so there's more for them and there's less for me
behind closed doors, a lot of six god worshipping
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old ?
yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yute when i was writin' views
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
wakin' up to public statements about my private life
you overnight celebrity, you one day star
i want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
i'll probably self-destruct if i ever lose, but i never do
to not even showin' up to a club 'less we doin' bis'
they don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
my life is centered 'round competition and currency
yeah, stylin' though
might move our annual shit to the 'dome
all the love i need is at the rodeo
i don't have no time to be no romeo
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
or they check for me, whatever splits it up
swear i told you that i'm in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
get no sick days, i leave for like three months in six days
and frame it like they just want the best for me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
i don't want to have to go to funerals
especially people that want to lecture me
all the things i know, i still been silent though
eighty-one they'll bring the crashers to the party
someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
i only love my bed and my momma, i'm sorry
they gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
i been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
without forty oli, there would be no me
don't pull up at six am and cuddle with me
and you know me
i finessed down weston road, ay, 'nessed
imagine if i never met the broskies
she say, " do you love me ? " i tell her, " only partly "
i feel good, sometimes i don't, ay, don't

tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
might go down as g-o-d, yeah, wait
it's a lot of bad things
that they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
fifty dope, i even got it tatted on me
hope i got some brothers that outlive me
might go down a g-o-d, yeah, wait
i make sure that northside eat, yuh
guess i see the things that they wishin' on me
god's plan, god's plan
i make sure that northside eat
protection that god gave me
champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in i
come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
i taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
the studio " the chapel " , i hate to travel
wakin' up at six pm like, " where does the day go ? "
i just pulled up on solana show, the girl's a natural
and sleep at the opposite times
tell 'em i don't wanna link like a broken necklace
tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
two thousand and ten was when i lost my halo
i got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
i knew her way back when hollywood was international
all that peace and that unity
closed off but i could never stay closed
shit is nice, but i prefer madeo
shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
the one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
two thousand and seventeen i lost a j. lo
my body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
caterin' is from giorgio baldi, robyn's favorite
promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
i'll be in better company with my own reflection
dirty thirty workin' on me
'cause niggas started talkin' to me like i'm slowin' down
word to the flags that belong in the hood of my benz
get a run around and i'll bury you where they won't find ya
yeah, who am i ? the do or die
i broke spirits that i never meant to
or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
opinions over statistics, of course
black excellence, but i guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
all that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
girls huggin' me then askin' me, " what scent that is, boy ? "
yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
i've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
yeah, the furthest i've been, that's word to my ends
i refuse to comply with regulations
knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
they tell me " don't worry, i got your money " like osirus
that just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
check the guest list
i had to lay low, hot topic like your everyday clothes
if opps make an appearance at least it's expected
